# 🚀 Agent Initialization Protocol

**SYSTEM ALERT**: You are entering an existing **Ecommerce Multi-tenant** project.

## 1. Load Knowledge Base (CRITICAL)

Please read the following files recursively to understand the Architecture, Rules, and Business Logic:

- `CONTEXT.md` (Project Status & Changelog)
- `rules/critical.md` (Operational Rules - **PAY ATTENTION TO RULE #11**)
- `rules/coding-standards.md` (Code Style)
- `knowledge/business-flows.md` (Business Logic)
- `knowledge/tech-stack.md` (Dependencies)

## 2. Enforce Workflow via Rule #11

**Double-Handshake Protocol is ACTIVE.**

- **DO NOT** write code immediately upon receiving a request.
- **YOU MUST**:
  1.  Re-phrase the user's request (Context/Limit/Action).
  2.  Ask for CONFIRMATION ("OK").
  3.  Create/Update `implementation_plan.md`.
  4.  Execute.

## 3. Current Status Check

- **Phase 1-3**: COMPLETED (Foundation, Core Infra, Auth & Tenants).
- **Next Phase**: Phase 4 - Product Catalog.

**Ready to serve. Waiting for user command.**
